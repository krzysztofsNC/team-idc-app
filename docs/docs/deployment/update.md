# Update TEAM solution

Ensure that the **parameters.sh** in the **deployment** folder is up to date before updating the TEAM solution
{: .note}

Run the **update.sh** bash script in the **deployment** folder to update the TEAM application to the latest version.

The **update.sh** bash script performs the following actions:

- Adds the AWS samples github repo as a git remote
- Pulls the latest version of the TEAM code
- Push the latest version to the TEAM code commit repo which triggers the amplify build and deployment 
- Removes the AWS samples github repo as a git remote

  > Ensure that the named profile for the **TEAM Deployment account** has sufficient permissions before executing the **update.sh** script

Execute the following command in the root directory to deploy the script

```
cd deployment
./update.sh
```

Once the upgrade script has completed execution, go to the AWS Amplify console to monitor the status of the TEAM application build and deployment.

## If upgrading to v1.1.2 
Due to an [ongoing issue](https://github.com/aws-samples/iam-identity-center-team/issues/236) the ***CLOUDTRAIL_AUDIT_LOGS*** parameter is no longer optional but now a mandatory parameter that accepts the ARN of an existing Cloudtrail Lake event datastore.

If upgrading from v1.1.1 to v1.1.2, [create a new Cloudtrail lake event datastore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/query-event-data-store-cloudtrail.html) in the delegated admin account outside of TEAM and pass the ARN to the parameter.sh file as shown below:


```
CLOUDTRAIL_AUDIT_LOGS=arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:123456789101:eventdatastore/e646f20d-7959-4682-be84-6c5b8a37cf15
```


## Verify app deployment
Go to Amplify console: **AWS Amplify -> All apps -> TEAM-IDC-APP -> Hosting environments**. On the **Hosting environments** tab, click on the application URL to confirm that it was deployed successfully and you can access the TEAM application landing page as shown in the video below:
